A Class should have a single primary responsibility. It should only have one reason to change. It's a bad idea to add more than one responsibility to a Class. If you need additional responsibilities -> just make other class. It doesn't really cost you anything. Anti-Pattern: God object or God Class.

Another term that we use - it's "separation of concerns". We split up complicated functionality into several diff parts which are somehow related (persistence, filter...)

React: Component should do only one thing and does that well.
