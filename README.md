# design-patterns-in-javascript

Liskov Substitution Principle (OCP) This principle says: if you have a function which take a base class like a rectangle, it should be able to take a derived class (like a square) whithout breaking the functioanlity in any way whatsoever

For React: 'Components should abide by some kind of contract'
So whenever a component uses another component, it shouldnâ€™t break its functionality (or create any surprises).
