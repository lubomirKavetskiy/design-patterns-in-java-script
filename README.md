Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

‘Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension (inheritance), but closed for modification.’
You should not jump to the Class and modify (add new methods) it just create sepate Classes and combine them.

This principle tells you to write code in such a way that you will be able to add additional functionality without changing the existing code.
